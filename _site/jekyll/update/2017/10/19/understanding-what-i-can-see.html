                <p>I often struggle to explain to people what I can see in what situations, so the best way to explain this is to show you is with some pictures that I have created that describe what I see in various situations.</p>

<p>The eye conditions that I have are :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bilateral moderate myopia
    <ul>
      <li>short sighted in both eyes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bilateral congenital cataracts
    <ul>
      <li>born with cataracts in both eyes, a problem to do with development of the eyes of the foetus in the womb.</li>
      <li>in left eye the cataract is central, causing spatial distortions and rendering the eye useless for reading or anything except peripheral vision</li>
      <li>in the right eye the cataract is off to one side so does not cause the spatial distortions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deprivational Amblyopia / Lazy left eye
    <ul>
      <li>because of the central cataract my left eye didn’t develop normally</li>
      <li>this is better known as causing double vision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bilateral pigment dispersion syndrome
    <ul>
      <li>the iris colouring is falling off, floating into the eye and blocking the draining canal, which builds up the pressure, which leads to glaucoma.</li>
      <li>moderate myopics are more prone to this apparently.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many situations that my eyesight causes me problems, but as I spend most of my time in front of a computer, I’ll start with that one … the others will appear as time goes by.</p>

<h1 id="at-my-desk">At my desk</h1>

<p>I’ve spent a little bit of time putting together some images to help illustrate how it affects my day to day job … it’s not a huge impact … but it has some consequences that I do endeavour to work around and appear to be as ‘normal’ as possible … even though I’m very much at the thin end of that bell curve.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/eyes/raw-screenshot-area-of-focus.png" alt="" class="img-large-right" /></p>

<p>My monitor set up is two 24inch wide-screen monitors (DELL U2414M) lying horizontally but the pair aligned vertically centred to the middle of my right eye. I sit with my right eye vertically in the middle of my upper monitor about 3/4 of the way down the screen if I look straight ahead with my eyes. My eye is about 20cm away from the screen at the nearest point.</p>

<p>I’ve captured the screens without any effects (apart from obscuring sensitive information), I believe is what you would see if you could see both screens in focus all at the same time … I don’t know whether that is what 20/20 vision people are able to see when they look at their monitors … maybe someone could comment … I appreciate that our brain focuses on a small area and the rest becomes blurred to some extent … but how much others can see and read at once without moving their eyes from the focussed area I don’t know.</p>

<p>I’m going to show you what I can see if I focus on the token ‘printerName’ highlighted in the code snipped in the image above with a yellow eliptical(-ish) highlight on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/eyes/left-eye-only.png" alt="" class="img-large-left" />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/eyes/right-eye-only.png" alt="" class="img-large-right" /></p>

<p>If I close one eye at a time and [try to] look at the word ‘printerName’ in that yellow highlighted area … the two pictures below show what I can see with my eyes individually if I try to take in the whole picture without moving my eye. The white and blue areas in the lower screen really become solid blocks of white with a blue line above … but I can vaguely make out that it is not solid colour.</p>

<p>Having seen both eyes separately, you obviously know that our brains will attempt to combine the images from both eyes into one 3D view.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/eyes/what-i-can-see.png" alt="" class="img-large-right" /></p>

<p>So, if I open both eyes and try to view the screens normally then I see something similar to this with my brain …  the distortion that I get with the left eye comes and goes depending on how long I’ve been looking at the screen … it is there when I initially look at the monitor and fades out the longer I concentrate on the text with my right eye.</p>

<p>I do see two images that do not align and I mostly notice this on the left hand side (when I look towards my nose with my right eye)</p>

<p>A reason I wear headphones a lot … imagine notifications popping up in the far corners of the screens … or for Skype for Busiess which seems to popup in the background behind other windows … that’s why I don’t see them … but I can hear them if I wear the headphones.</p>
