                <p>I have been looking around for something that is a bit more flexible than blogger and wordpress … After a bit of consultation with my friends over at <a href="http://www.includecpp.org" target="_blank">#include &lt;C++&gt;</a> I decided to investigate <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> which uses <a href="https://rubygems.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Gems</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
 to provide a framework for our masterpieces and powers the local development and final delivery of the pages once published to your default GitHub repo blog.</p>

<p>I chose the <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight" target="_blank">Midnight theme</a> as it is clean and the text is very reable … However it didn’t come with a blog by default so I did a bit of googling and found the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#displaying-an-index-of-posts" target="_blank">Jekyll documentation on posts</a></p>

<p>So I have a blog now … and have gone back and added my other blog posts on here from other sites … have published the site all together and directed people to it. So any posts prior in time to now are from old sites … any after now until a new technology comes along are on this site.</p>
