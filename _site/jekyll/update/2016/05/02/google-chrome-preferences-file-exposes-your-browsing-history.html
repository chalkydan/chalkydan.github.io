                <p>So there’s been a few emails circulating recently about Internet Explorer and Edge exposing your private browsing history and horror of horrors not being on our side.</p>

<p>Well how many of you have thought that Chrome was immune to this … ?</p>

<p>Have a look inside your Preferences file …</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Preferences
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… search for bits of your favourite website url inside this file … chances are you will find it embedded in there somewhere … along with it’s friends.</p>

<p>Clearing your browser history cache of urls and such makes no difference to the content of this file.</p>

<p>The file also contains a mysterious section at the bottom … encrypted … would love to know what’s in there.</p>

<p>You will need to kill ALL running Chrome instances in order to be able to successfully (and permanently) delete this file … don’t worry … it doesn’t seem to make much difference to your browsing experience (including passwords etc)… it’s just the dodgy urls are now gone.</p>

<p>If the file returns within a few seconds and you haven’t launched Chrome … you didn’t kill them all before you deleted the file … this new file will have your urls in it again.</p>

<p>Not sure when they are written to this file though … or if they still are … but they seem to be historical from other machines on which I use Chrome with the same google account.</p>
